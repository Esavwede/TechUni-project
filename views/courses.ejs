                    The Backend Development course aims to teach the backend development from
                    basic to advanced level. At the end of this course, the learner is expected to be able
                    to create reliable webservers and apis in node.js. The course takes a project driven
                    approach, where the lessons thought is used to build an actual project.
                    This advanced course on Node.js teaches learners how to create more reliable,
                    secured and robust applications in Node.js. With introduction to the MongoDB
                    database, the student gets to store user data, insert, update and delete data when
                    the need arises. Choosing a flexible database like MongoDB makes it a whole lot
                    easier.

                    design are the elements that carry the majority of the content in both the digital
                    world and the printed world. As graphic design becomes more visible and prevalent
                    in our lives, graphic design as a practice becomes more important in our culture.
                    Through visual examples, this course will teach you the fundamental principles of
                    graphic design. Beyond the basics, you will also learn tips and tricks to become a
